        Growing up in the middle of a transitioning world has been rewarding. 
        At a young age I was introduced to technology, but not the kind like today.
        If I ever accidentally pressed the "Network" button on my flip phone, I frantically
        closed it, thinking that my parents were about to be billed hundred of dollars because
        I connected to the internet.

        In college, once I took my first MIS class I knew that I had found my major.
        Programming, database creation, and cyber security were the classes I loved the most.
        They were all challenging, yet rewarding.
        From the months of August to December in 2016, I studied abroad in Arezzo, Italy and earned a
        International Area Studies minor while exploring Europe. During this time I taught Italian high school students
        basic American History, Native American culture, and English. It was there that I developed my leadership skills.
