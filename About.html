        Growing up in the middle of a transitioning world showed me the best of both worlds.
        At the turn of the century, technology was rapidly growing, yet
        dial up was still dominant and "smart phones" were not a thought.
        At the age of 9, I took a part in disassembling an old Dell desktop, and was intrigued
        with all of its workings.

        In college, once I took my first MIS class I knew that I had found my major.
        Programming, database creation, and cyber security were the classes I loved the most.
        They were all challenging, yet rewarding.

        From the months of August to December in 2016, I studied abroad in Arezzo, Italy and earned a
        International Area Studies minor while exploring Europe.
